<h1>Oregon Health and Sciences University</h1>
<p>I am majoring in biological sciences and am interested in epidemiology and public health. This is also a learning hospital which have great standards. There is interesting research happening at this school as well. I put a link to what I think would be the best place to get started reading if one is interested in this school and needs information to get started.</p>

<h2>University of Oregon</h2>
<p>A university somewhat similar to OHSU in the way that it has a wider variety of programs compared to OSU. A great university with diverse options for many different kinds of career pathways, and a friendly local vibe. This is a link to their Public Health and Human Sciences school which is what I would be interested in.</p>

<h3>Oregon State University</h3>
<p>This school is the local and cheaper, easier option for me at least, and is my third choice. It offers programs that would satisfy the path I want to take. This is a link to search all of their offered programs.</p>
